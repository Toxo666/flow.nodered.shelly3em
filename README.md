What to do?
Prize calculation on changed prizes with correct historical data. eg: When change cost/month -> calculate prize from history until today with old cost/month but from now on with new cost/month and summarize it.

I will work on this.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
I'm thinking of doing this with an influx query.
